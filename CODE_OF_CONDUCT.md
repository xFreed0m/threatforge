# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

  and learning from the experience

  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing skill levels and backgrounds
* Showing appreciation for contributions of all types and sizes

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

* **GitHub Repository**: Issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments
* **Documentation**: Wiki, README, and other documentation contributions
* **Community Events**: Online meetups, conferences, or ThreatForge-related gatherings
* **Social Media**: When representing ThreatForge or referencing the project
* **External Forums**: Security forums, conferences, or discussions where ThreatForge is mentioned

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Create an issue with the `conduct` label
2. **Direct Contact**: Email the project maintainers (if email is available)
3. **Private Discussion**: Use GitHub Discussions with a direct message to maintainers

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:

* **Description**: What happened and when
* **Context**: Where the incident occurred (issue, PR, discussion, etc.)
* **Evidence**: Links to comments, screenshots, or other relevant information
* **Impact**: How the behavior affected you or others
* **Desired Outcome**: What resolution you're seeking

### Privacy and Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. We will:

* Keep reporter identity confidential unless you explicitly consent to disclosure
* Only share information necessary for investigation and resolution
* Protect against retaliation for good-faith reports
* Provide updates on the status of your report when possible

## Enforcement

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Appeal Process

If you believe you have been wrongly accused or that the enforcement action was
inappropriate, you may appeal by:

1. **Submit an Appeal**: Create a new issue with the `appeal` label
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why you believe the action was inappropriate
3. **Request Review**: Ask for a review by different community leaders
4. **Timeline**: Appeals will be reviewed within 30 days

## Community Leadership
