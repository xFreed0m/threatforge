## System Description Best Practices

### 1. Be Comprehensive
**Do:**
- Include all major system components

- Upload and download documents
- Make payments using credit cards
- Access support tickets

The system uses:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js/Express backend API
- PostgreSQL database with encryption
- Redis for session management

## Analysis Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
**Do:**
- Begin with basic system descriptions
- Use simple frameworks initially
- Focus on core functionality
- Build complexity gradually

**Don't:**
- Start with complex systems
- Use advanced frameworks immediately
- Include unnecessary details
- Overwhelm the analysis

### 2. Iterate and Refine
**Do:**
- Review initial results
- Refine system descriptions
- Try different frameworks
- Update based on findings

**Example Iteration Process:**
1. Generate initial threat model
2. Review identified threats
3. Refine system description
4. Try different framework
5. Compare results
6. Implement improvements

### 3. Validate Results
**Do:**
- Have security experts review results
- Validate identified threats
- Check for missing threats
- Verify risk assessments

**Don't:**
- Accept results without review
- Ignore expert feedback
- Skip validation steps
- Assume AI is always correct

### 4. Use Multiple Perspectives
**Do:**
- Try different frameworks
- Get different viewpoints
- Compare results
- Combine insights

**Example Multi-Framework Approach:**
1. Start with STRIDE for general threats
2. Use LINDDUN for privacy analysis
3. Apply PASTA for business context
4. Create attack trees for critical threats

## Risk Management

### 1. Prioritize Threats
**High Priority:**
